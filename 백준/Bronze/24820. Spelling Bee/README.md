### 문제 설명

<p><img alt="" src="" style="width: 200px; height: 272px; float: right;">The New York Times publishes a daily puzzle called the "Spelling Bee." In this puzzle, $7$ letters are shown in a hexagonal arrangement of $6$ letters around a center letter.  The task is to come up with as many words as possible that </p>

<ul>
	<li>contain only letters that are displayed in the hexagon,</li>
	<li>are at least of length $4$, and</li>
	<li>contain the center letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>A letter may be used more than once, and not all letters need to be used.</p>

<p>After playing for a while, you get stuck, but then you remind yourself that the Linux distribution on your computer comes with a machine-readable file of $102\,305$ dictionary words in <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code>!</p>

<p>You decide that even if you can't excel at the Spelling Bee you can still excel at programming, so you decide to write a program that finds all solutions to a Spelling Bee puzzle from your dictionary.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single test case, which starts with a line with $7$ distinct lowercase English letters. The first of these letters is the center letter.  The next line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 102\,305$), the size of the dictionary. This line is followed by $n$ lines, each containing a dictionary word of $l$ lowercase English letters ($1 \le l \le 24$).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the word list matching the Spelling Bee puzzle in the order in which they appear in the dictionary.  You are guaranteed that at least one dictionary entry will match.</p>
